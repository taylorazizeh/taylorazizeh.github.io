abstract: 'Taylor Azizeh, a first-year Ph.D. student at OSUâ€™s Marine Mammal Institute, joins Matt to discuss how climate change might be driving gray whales to shift their feeding habits along the Pacific Northwest coast. Taylor's research explores the phenomenon of 'prey switching,' where these benthic specialists switch from seafloor to water-column feeding. By combining stable isotope analysis, GPS tracking, and drone photogrammetry, Taylor aims to understand how gray whales adapt to changing prey availability in a warming ocean. Listen in to hear about her journey from Costa Rica to London to OSU, her passion for these majestic animals, and the big-picture questions she seeks to answer. Hosted by Matthew Vaughan.'
