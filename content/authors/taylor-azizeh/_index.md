I am currently a [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) at [Moss Landing Marine Laboratories](https://mlml.sjsu.edu/) in the [Vertebrate Ecology Lab](). My master's thesis focuses on the foraging ecology of late chick-rearing emperor penguins in the Ross Sea. Broadly, my research interests include wildlife ecology, bioenergetics, the effects of disturbance, habitat use, and more. Prior to this, I attended the [University of Idaho (UI)](https://www.uidaho.edu/) where I double majored in [Environmental Science](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/undergraduate-majors/bs-envs) and [Wildlife Resources](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/undergraduate-majors/bs-wildlife). At the UI, I founded the Idaho Chapter of the [Women in Science Society](https://www.womeninsciencesociety.org/), participated in the [NSF IRES](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/international-research-experiences-students-ires-0) program, and worked as a Student Ambassador for the [College of Natural Resources](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr). Post-graduation, I spent a year in Denmark and Greenland as a [Fulbright](https://fulbright.org/) student, studying marine wildlife and polar ecosystems. I also spent time working with the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/), [LeopardSeals.org](https://www.leopardseals.org/), and [Oceanomare Delphis Onlus](https://oceanomaredelphis.org/en/).
